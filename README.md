## Introduction 

This portfolio was built as a personal frontend challenge after completing my React and Next.js courses. My main goal was to reinforce my frontend fundamentals and gain confidence building a real-world project from scratch.

The project emphasizes clean component architecture, reusable UI patterns, smooth animations, and an overall polished user experience. It was fully designed and developed independently as a hands-on frontend challenge using React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Zustand.

## Features

- **Clean Component Architecture**: All UI components are modular and reusable, making the codebase easy to maintain.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and animations are implemented using Framer Motion for a polished experience.
- **Global State Management**: Zustand is used for efficient state handling across the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout to ensure the portfolio looks great on any device.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays my projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.
- **Interactive UI**: Components respond to user interactions for an engaging experience.

## Tools & Technologies

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for safer and more maintainable code.
- **Vite**: Fast development build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Framer Motion**: Library for smooth animations.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management solution.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened my understanding of core React concepts and component architecture.
- Applied global state management using Zustand in a real project.
- Improved frontend decision-making, UI structuring, and project planning from scratch.
